- Engineered backend orchestration with prompt validation, error handling, and usage/cost tracking, backed by a PostgreSQL history service for reliable, auditable AI operations
- Built context checks and reusable React/Next.js UI components to validate inputs and streamline chat workflows, improving reusability, performance, and secure user interactions
- Deployed across multi-cloud environments (Azure, AWS S3, API Gateway) for serverless AI endpoints and Azure PaaS for orchestration, integrated with CI/CD pipelines for secure, automated delivery

### Senior Software Engineer at Infosys Limited (November 2018 - November 2019)

I worked in Pune, India as a Senior Software Engineer. My key accomplishments include:

- Designed, developed, and deployed RESTful microservices and integration APIs in Spring Boot, leveraging MVC/SQL and JVM/XML messaging to improve service scalability, reducing provisioning cycle time by 30%, ensuring scalable and secure OSS/BSS data flow
- Led migration of legacy services to AWS Lambda, introducing EC2 for compute, S3 for storage, and IAM roles for fine-grained access control, improving scalability and compliance
- Refactored monolithic backend modules into independently deployable AWS-hosted microservices, integrated with CI/CD pipelines (Git, Jenkins), increasing deployment speed by 50%
- Implemented Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) automation using Terraform and AWS CloudFormation templates, enhancing predictability and reducing manual intervention in AWS/OSS/BSS deployments

### Software Engineer at Tech Mahindra Limited (August 2015 - November 2018)

I worked in Pune, India and Leeds, UK as a Software Engineer. My accomplishments include:
